ex. a pc has a motherboard, the case, monitor
            those three are not computers but a computer has all this parts
            So thats what composition is



       Composition follows HAS-A relationship

       Inheritance follows IS-A relationship

       For example:-

       Bathroom HAS-A Tub ----------------------> Composition

       Dog IS-A Animal    --------------------------> Inheritance

       You cannot say Bathroom IS-A Tub, it simply doesn't make sense, hence when we have HAS-A relationship, we use Composition.

       Similarly, Dog IS-A animal, Dog HAS-A animal makes no sense.
