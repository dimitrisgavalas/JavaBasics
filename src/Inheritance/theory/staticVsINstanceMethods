                 2. cant access instance methods/variables directly
                 3. used for operations that don't require any data from instance of the class
                 4. cant use this keyword
                 5. Dont require in stance to be created(ex. dont need--> className name = new className();)

Instance Methods = 1. belongs to an instance of a class
                   2. to use first we have to instantiate the class first by using new keyword
                   3. can access methods/variables directly


How to choose?
            - If it uses fields or instance methods --> Instance Methods
            - If not --> static Methods
