Class = blueprint for a house. With the blueprint we can build many houses

Object = each house you build is an object also known as an instance

Reference = Each house we build has an address. If we want to tell someone
            where we live we give the our address(ex. on a paper). That is a reference.

            We can copy the reference as many times we like but there is still
            one object.(ex. copying paper with address on not the house)

            We can pass references as parameters to Constructors and methods

            Example
            1. House class
            2. c // creates new instance of the House class
            3. House = blueprint
            4. blueHouse = variable
            5. reference to the same object // House anotherHouse = blueHouse;
            6. blueHouse + anotherHouse = two papers with address
            7. House greenHouse = new House("green"); // second object(1st blueHouse).
                3rd reference(2nd blueHouse, 3rd anotherHouse)
